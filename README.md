# ElixirLanceDB

This library aims to bring the fantastic [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/) embedded multimodal vector search database to the BEAM. As LanceDB is written in Rust, this integration uses Rustler to map NIFs to the Lance Rust client.

> ðŸš§ This project is very new, in active development, and is not published on Hex. ðŸš§

> ðŸš§ Feel free to fork, borrow from, or use at your own risk, but do expect the API to change. ðŸš§
